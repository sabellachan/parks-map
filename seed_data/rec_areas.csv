"The San Pedro riparian area, containing about 40 miles of the upper San Pedro River, was designated by Congress as a National Conservation Area (NCA) on November 18, 1988. The primary purpose for the designation is to protect and enhance the desert riparian ecosystem, a rare remnant of what was once an extensive network of similar riparian systems throughout the Southwest.  Many recreational opportunities are available within the NCA.  Three of the most popular sites are :  	 Murray Springs Clovis Site,  a significant archaeological site that contains an undisturbed stratigraphic record of the past 40,000 years. Excavations were conducted by the University of Arizona  from 1966 to 1971. People first arrived in this area 11,000 years ago. They belonged to what  we now call the Clovis Culture and were the earliest known people to have inhabited North America. Named after the distinctive and beautifully crafted Clovis spear points they made, they were expert hunters of the large mammals of the last Ice Age. An interpretive trail leads visitors through the site. From Sierra Vista, take State Highway 90 east 6 miles to Monson Road. Turn left, and go about 1.2 miles to the signed turnoff to Murray Springs. The access road is located on the right.  	 The Spanish Presidio Santa Cruz de Terrenate is the most intact remaining example of a once-extensive network of similar presidios. These fortresses marked the northern extension of New Spain into the New World. Only a stone foundation and a few remaining adobe wall remnants mark the location of an isolated and dangerous military station.  From Fairbank on Highway 82, drive approximately 2 miles west on Highway 82, turn right on the Kellar Ranch Road and travel approximately 3 miles to the trailhead.   Hike about 2 miles to the ruins and interpretive displays.

Did you know that over thirteen million people go camping each year in the United States? And most of them will build a campfire? Campfires are fun, but those small fires can turn into a large wildland fire in a hurry.<br />	(Noise: fire engine siren)<br />	Don&rsquo;t forget to put your campfire out tonight. It could be in your backyard tomorrow by not properly putting out your campfire when you&rsquo;re finished, small embers can blow into the brush and start a wildfire. You could be responsible for the costs for putting out that fire and any damages it may cause.&nbsp; <a href=""https://youtu.be/HVbNY6GWRo4"">https://youtu.be/HVbNY6GWRo4</a></p><p>	Thousands of bears live in our forests and mountains. Often the same places we like to camp and hike. This poses a safety concern for both bears and humans. Bears may not be your number one concern when camping, but they should be. Be bear aware. Keep a clean camp site. Don&rsquo;t keep food, shampoo, or anything with a strong scent in tents or sleeping areas and do not sleep in the clothes you cook in. Help us keep wildlife wild while protecting human and animal life.

"The Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge stretches across 20.5 miles between Melbourne Beach and Wabasso Beach along Florida's east coast. The refuge was established in 1991 and was named after the late Dr. Archie Carr, Jr., in honor of his extraordinary contribution to sea turtle conservation. The Refuge is a direct result of Dr. Carr bringing attention to the world's declining turtle populations due to over-exploitation and loss of safe habitat. The refuge was designated to protect habitat for what is the most significant area for loggerhead sea turtle nesting in the Western Hemisphere, and the most significant area for green turtle nesting in North America. This represents 25-35% of all loggerhead and green sea turtle nests in the US. It also serves as a minor nesting area for the leatherback turtle, which is one of the world's largest and rarest sea turtles. The long stretches of quiet, undisturbed sandy beaches, with little or no artificial light, are essential to the reproductive success and survival of the 15,000 to 20,000 sea turtles nesting annually. The 248-acre refuge is also unique for its placement within a patchwork of protected lands and among properties that have already been developed. To help preserve this globally important nesting ground the Service has established a partnership with State and County governments and private conservation groups to acquire and manage this dune habitat. The primary management thrust is to provide long term protection of this habitat for sea turtles and other listed species as well as providing compatible public use.

Together, the State and the Service have been able to develop large complexes of habitat for waterfowl and other wildlife species. Although the Wetland Management District encompasses 35 counties, at this date, there are WPAs in 16counties. Most acquisitions are intended to increase habitat at existing wetland complexes, so it is unlikely that tractswill be acquired in the entire 35-county area. Most WPAs are small, from 100 to 500 acres, but several havegrown considerably. Union Hills WPA in Cerro Gordo County is the largest in Iowa at over 2,000 acres.Spring Run, a large complex of State and Federal lands in Dickinson County, is the second largest WPA.Dugout Creek WPA in Dickinson County and Lower Morse Lake in Wright County are also among the largerrestored tracts in the Iowa Wetland Management District.",1436,43.26670074,-94.11669922,Iowa Wetland Management District,515-928-2523 ,

The mainland refuge unit, the Hunting Islands, and Price Island are in Washington. Tenasillahe Island, Wallace Island, and several parcels around Westport are in Oregon.The valuable habitat the refuge preserves for the deer also benefits a large variety of wintering birds, a small herd of Roosevelt elk, river otter, various reptiles and amphibians including painted turtles and red-legged frogs, and several pairs of nesting bald eagles and osprey.    The Columbian white-tailed deer is one of 30 subspecies of white-tailed deer in North America, and the only one found west of the Cascade Mountains. These deer once ranged throughout the river valleys west of the Cascade Mountains from the Umpqua River in Oregon, northward through the Willamette Valley to Puget Sound, and westward down the lower Columbia River.During the 1800s, deer numbers were dangerously low due to overhunting and loss of habitat. By the turn of the century, they had disappeared from nearly all of their range and, in the 1930s, were thought to be extinct. Remnant populations were discovered here and near Roseburg, Oregon.In 1968, the lower Columbia River population was listed as a federally endangered species because it was in imminent danger of becoming extinct. This population is now found only along the lower Columbia River between Skamokawa, Washington, and Clatskanie, Oregon.Today, about 300 of these deer live on the refuge. Another 300-400 live on private lands along the river.

"Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge is, at 1.637 million acres, about the size of the state of Delaware. It sits atop the Arctic Circle, with approximately a third of the refuge above that meridian and two-thirds below. The refuge is a prime example of Alaska's boreal ecosystem, which is dominated by black and white spruce with some white birch and poplars. The region's typically short, hot summers give rise to numerous thunderstorms and lightning strikes. This results in a continuous cycle of burn and recovery.  Natural wildfires create diverse habitats with different plant species, and levels of maturity within each species.  The resulting mosaic of habitat types supports a variety of wildlife.The refuge's migratory fish, chinook, chum and coho salmon, as well as sheefish, are creatures of extremes. Its Sheefish make the longest spawning journey of any of their species' population on record, while Kanuti's salmon travel more than 1000 miles up the Yukon before entering the Koyukuk River system to spawn. Refuge waters support twelve other fish species, including arctic grayling and northern pike.Protecting breeding habitat for migratory birds is central to the mission of Kanuti National Wildlife Refuge and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.  Nearly 130 species of birds spend part or all of the year on refuge lands. With the loss of wetlands in regions outside of Alaska, the importance of Kanuti as a nesting area for birds is likely to increase.The refuge's boreal forest is home to 37 species of mammals, including brown and black bears, several wolf packs, moose, wolverine, beavers, muskrats, marten and mink.

Following purchase of land, the Civilian Conservation Corps began work on the refuge creating wetlands, constructing roads and buildings, and initiating the refuge farming program. The primary purpose of the refuge is to provide nesting, resting, and feeding areas for waterfowl, primarily ducks. An important secondary purpose was to preserve a remnant flock of prairie chickens. Unfortunately, adequate grassland habitat to maintain a viable population of the birds was not available. Since establishment of the refuge, the primary emphasis on waterfowl species has been expanded to include the Eastern Prairie Population of Canada geese. Canada geese were first observed using the refuge in the early1940s, and numbers increased gradually to peak populations over 150,000 birds annually. Although these populations have steadily declined, Swan Lake is stillconsidered a primary wintering area for Canada geese. The refuge lies in the floodplain of the Grand River, near its confluence with the Missouri River in north-central Missouri. Flooding is common, especially during spring and summer periods. In addition to waterfowl management objectives, providing habitat for residentwildlife, protecting endangered and threatened species, encouraging biodiversity,developing shorebird habitat, and providing public opportunites for outdoor recreation and environmental education are on-going programs.",1629,39.60829926,-93.1832962,Swan Lake National Wildlife Refuge,660-856-3323,

A drive to one of our national forests provides opportunities for hiking, running, walking, bicycling, swimming, and canoeing.</p><p>	Exercising in the great outdoors can burn just as many calories as jogging on a treadmill, and an additional benefit includes watching nature. Many of our lakes are wrapped with glistening beaches for swimming and relaxing. Twenty-seven recreation sites are available that include beaches for swimming; lifeguards are not present. Beaches are located in the Bankhead, Conecuh, and Talladega National Forests (Shoal Creek and Oakmulgee Districts) with places for canoeing and other water sports.</p><p>	If you enjoy cycling as a form of exercising, mountain bicycles are the appropriate choice for designated mountain bike trails. For the hiker, our forests are filled with wonders. Moderate to difficult trails are delineated throughout, featuring floral and vegetative viewing and occasional wildlife observation.</p><p>	Largemouth bass, bream, catfish, and crappie await the luring enticement of the forest angler in our beautiful lakes. Additionally, horse trail riders find meandering trails, fully furnished with picnicking areas, camping locations, and restroom facilities. Even hunters may sharpen their shooting skills at one of our shooting ranges.</p><p>	Other outdoor activities such as boating, picnicking, bird-watching, camping, and all-terrain vehicle riding on designated trails are available.</p><p>	So, get more out of life as you re-create your physical self in the recreation of the great Alabama outdoors!</p><p>	<strong>Plan Your Trip</strong></p><p>	A good rule of thumb when choosing an outdoor exercising activity in the national forest is to be prepared before you leave.

Become familiar with the type of recreation activity the trail is designed for and be aware of the terrain, distance and elevation before using the trail. Maps can provide detailed descriptions about the trail and help in deciding which workout is right for you. In terms of outer wear, a good pair of trail hiking shoes can provide a harder sole for stepping in rocky areas. It is of primary importance to be equipped with the following 10 essentials on all hiking trips: map, compass, whistle (3 blasts for help), flashlight, sharp knife, fire starter, water, first-aid kit, extra food and clothing suitable for the season.

Lake Powell is part of the <A HREF=""http://www.nps.gov/glca"">Glen Canyon National Recreation Area</a>.The Bureau of Reclamation started construction of Glen Canyon Dam in 1956 and Lake Powell started filling on March 13, 1963. In 1980, 17 years after the diversion tunnel gates were closed, Lake Powell filled completely. Today, over 20 million people depend on the waters of Lake Powell to sustain life.The Glen Canyon National Recreation Area was established in 1972 and is operated by the <A HREF=""http://www.nps.gov"">National Park Service</a>. Visitors to the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area number about 2.4 million annually. The Hole in the Rock, Crossing of the Fathers, and Rainbow Bridge National Monument are all publicly-accessible historic sites steeped in western frontier and environmental history.  However, all are reached on the lake by boat.  The Carl Hayden Visitor Center, named after the late Arizona Senator, contains exhibits that focus on the history of the dam and Glen Canyon. With its hundreds of miles of shoreline, Lake Powell affords opportunities for hiking, camping, swimming, boating, and fishing. Although all types of water sports are popular, boating and fishing are the prime attractions. Lake Powell, which offers some of the nation's finest fishing, contains bass, bluegill, green sunfish, walleye, black crappie, northern pike, and catfish. In the river below the dam, the clear, cold waters released from the depths of Lake Powell create a perfect habitat for trout.

It winds through the rugged canyons of the Gila Mountains and Turtle Mountain.With the exception of Bonita Creek, streams and springs are scarce along the route. Follow bear and mountain lion country precautions as these creatures are becoming more common along Bonita Creek. The creek's clear, cool water is inviting for a soak, but must be treated before drinking due to human, cattle, and wildlife activity upstream. Carry plenty of drinking water with you. Few people travel this remote route and it remains difficult to follow because it crosses land of mixed ownership. You will need topo maps and a compass to hike this moderate to difficult trail. The best time to hike is fall through the spring months because there is little water and shade. Snow is possible in the high elevations during the winter months.Permits/Fees: A recreation permit is needed for crossing Arizona state trust land one mile southwest of the East Trailhead. Permits are available by mail or in person at the Arizona State Land Office in Phoenix, Tucson, and Flagstaff, and from the Arizona Public Lands Information Center in Phoenix.A San Carlos Apache Tribal recreation permit should be obtained if you wish to cross the short section of the trail that passes through the reservation in T. 4 S., R. 28 E.

"Over 610 acres of towering 90+ foot sand dunes await your enjoyment in the Mescalero Sands North Dune Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) Area. The dune field stretches over most of the area and lends itself well to all terrain cycles, sand rails and dune buggies. The dunes are made up of quartz particles and are constantly changing due to the prevailing southwest wind. When the dunes are active they move about a foot per year. Among the biggest surprises in the area are the mature cottonwood trees. The combination of a very shallow water table and the sand's capacity to hold water allows these trees to thrive in an arid environment.While the road into Mescalero Sands is capable of supporting trucks and buses, the soft sand off established roads and parking lots is not. BLM does not recommend leaving the surfaced areas in any vehicle other than an all-terrain vehicle.The Bowl Parking Area provides access to the northern portion of the dunes, which includes the ""Bowl.""

In 1970 the Bogoslof Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. Aleuts believed that they heard the ""voice of God"" (bogoslof) as a fiery eruption lifted Bogoslof Island from the cold Bering Sea around 1796. Bogoslof and little Fire Island (about five acres) became Wilderness in 1970 and a subunit of the Aleutian Islands Unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge in 1980. An active volcanic island, Bogoslof has undergone change as recently as 1993. A single rugged spire, Castle Rock, stands above the island's rocky beaches and black lava. Vegetation on this domed and treeless isle is typical of the Aleutians: grasses, sedges, heath. As many as 90,000 murres, kittiwakes, puffins, and gulls nest here.

All of the Wilderness is in the state of Louisiana. In 1975 the Breton Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. Located off the delta of the great Mississippi River, Breton Island actually consists of two adjacent islands (north and south) with a combined length of about three miles and a width of less than one mile. Part of a long chain of barrier islands, they comprise only a small section of Breton National Wildlife Refuge. The greater portion of the refuge consists of the Chandeleur Islands, an approximately 20-mile-long crescent of land lying north of Breton. Between Breton and Chandeleur are more islands owned by the state and managed by the refuge. Geologically young, these unstable islands were created by the erosion and reshaping of a former Mississippi River delta. On the Gulf of Mexico side of the islands you'll find low sandy beaches tapering into a maze of ponds, inlets, and saltwater marshes. Hundreds of thousands of seabirds use these islands as nesting and wintering habitat. Endangered brown pelicans have made a dramatic return under careful refuge management. Camping is not allowed. Human visitors are common, sometimes coming for bird watching but primarily for surf fishing.

In 1984, to posthumously honor a New Jersey conservationist congressman, Brigantine National Wildlife Refuge (established in 1939) and Barnegat National Wildlife Refuge (established in 1967) were combined to create the Edwin B. Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge. Although the refuge consists of more than 39,000 acres, less than 7,000 acres in the southern division (the Brigantine) qualify as Wilderness. This trailless area, a tidal wetland and shallow bay habitat, is one of the most active flyways for migratory waterbirds in North America. Birdwatchers, binoculars in hand, have zoomed in on close to 300 species, including Atlantic brant and American black duck. The Wilderness also protects Holgate and Little Beaches, two of the few remaining barrier beaches in New Jersey. Grasses on these shores stabilize the fragile dunes and safeguard the rare piping plover, black skimmer, and least tern. The refuge is open during daylight hours, but there are prohibitions on camping, fires, horses, kite flying, swimming, flower picking, or anything else that might endanger the wildlife and their habitat.

No other place on the Atlantic coast attracts as many oystercatchers during winter. Waiting patiently until an oyster opens up, these splendid black and white birds strike suddenly, using their long red beaks to rip at the oyster's muscle. Here in summer you'll find thousands of terns and brown pelicans, and black skimmers flying with their black and red bills gaping to skim food from the surface of the ocean and estuaries. Hundreds of herons and egrets pace on long legs looking for food, and the beaches stir under the feet of godwits, whimbrels, and dowitchers. In the marshes, the clapper rails, sometimes more than 25,000 of them, fill the air with their strange clattering. Colorful songbirds migrate through in spring, joining year-round residents such as flickers and yellow-throated warblers. <p>Loggerhead sea turtles lay more eggs in these beaches than anywhere else along South Carolina's coast. Don't be surprised if you miss them, since they most often choose the night, when the refuge is closed, to drag their great broad backs from the ocean. <p>Two historic lighthouses, built in 1827 and 1857, stand as sentinels on Lighthouse Island. No longer operational, they serve as daytime landmarks for recreational boaters. Four public tours are offered annually to Lighthouse Island. Sea kayaking is the best way to see Cape Romain.

These keys, low islands rising just above the sea, are in fact one of the largest nesting areas in north Florida. The four outermost islands have been designated as Wilderness: Seahorse Key, North Key, Snake Key, and Bird Key (also known as Deadman's Key). Most of the keys were used as fishing camps or villages by ancient cultures thousands of years ago. <p>A prominent sandy ridge distinguishes Seahorse Key, recalling the island's past life as a huge sand dune (granted this was hundreds of thousands of years ago). The ridge crests at 52 feet above sea level, making it the highest point on Florida's Gulfcoast. The other keys barely make it to 20 feet above the waves. An upland forest of cabbage palm, red bay, live oak, and laurel oak covers the ridge, with an understory of saw palmetto, yaupon, wild olive, prickly pear, eastern red cedar, and Spanish bayonet. Salt marsh and estuarine waters dotted with mangrove dominate the lower elevations. <p>The most abundant species are white ibis, great egret, double-crested cormorant, snowy egret, tricolored heron, brown pelican, and great blue heron. Reptiles are common as well, including a dense population of cottonmouth snakes.

A small subunit of the Chukchi Sea Unit, Chamisso Island and nearby Puffin Island, were combined as a wildlife refuge in 1912, designated Wilderness in 1975, and added to the AMNWR in 1980. <p>Chamisso has one large sand spit and a low beach zone surrounding a covering of tundra with a few marshy bogs. Although Chamisso Island is much larger, Puffin Island houses many more nesting birds, especially horned puffins, black-legged kittiwakes, and thick-billed murres who build their nests on the steep-walled cliffs that fall into Spafarief Bay. An unusual sight is horned puffins digging burrows in which to lay their eggs, much like tufted puffins do. Eskimos still cross from the mainland to gather eggs, primarily from kittiwakes and murres. <p>Nothing lives on the islands except for birds and the occasional fox that wanders over on the frozen sea in winter. Walruses, seals, and whales often may be seen in Spafarief Bay. Boating is dangerous due to frequent storms that blow in during cool summers and frigid winters.

That figure is all the more impressive (and heartening) when you consider that only 50 birds inhabited the region when the area was officially slated for protection in 1908. Birders may observe these creatures from a rise near the lake, but the islands themselves are strictly off-limits. In addition to pelicans, you may encounter ducks, geese, swans, sharp-tailed grouse, ring-necked pheasants, gulls, cormorants, white-tailed deer, and many smaller mammals. Facilities are not available on site, and camping is not permitted. Of the 4,385 acres of Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge, 230 (separated from the rest of the refuge by a powerline) were not designated as Wilderness.

The Homosassa River runs through the northern Wilderness, while the Chassahowitzka River marks the uppermost boundary of the southern Wilderness. <p>Originally established for the benefit of waterfowl, the area now provides critical habitat to a diversity of wildlife, including endangered species such as the West Indian manatee and whooping crane. The tidal bays, rivers, and creeks of Chassahowitzka NWR provide summer habitat for the West Indian manatee. These gentle aquatic mammals consume 10 to 15 percent of their body weight each day. With some animals exceeding 1,000 pounds, the abundance growth of musk grass in Chassahowitzka's shallow bays provides an important food source for manatees. While manatees frequent the refuge most often during the summer months, whooping cranes can only be seen on the refuge during the winter months.

In 1980 the Koyukuk Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. <p>Think of 3.5-million-acre Koyukuk National Wildlife Refuge, and water comes to mind: there are 14 rivers, hundreds of meandering creeks, more than 15,000 lakes, all forming the floodplain of the Koyukuk River. The lands of the refuge are still of great importance to the Alaskans who live in villages within or adjacent to its boundaries. Local subsistence activities include gathering meat, fish and berries, trapping of furbearers, and cutting house logs and firewood. There are no roads and no maintained trails, but the lower Koyukuk River provides a ""highway"" through the heart of the refuge. <p>Moose are common within the refuge. Brown and black bears wade into the rivers in night-less summer to escape swarms of mosquitoes and other biting insects. Lynx, coyotes, red foxes, wolves, and wolverines might also be seen. Beavers abound, and thousands of migratory waterfowl nest and raise their young within the productive river basin. The rivers and wetlands are also habitat to salmon, sheefish, pike and grayling. <p>Four-hundred thousand acres of the Koyukuk Refuge are preserved as Wilderness. Miles of boreal forest surround a unique geological feature -- the Nogahabara Sand Dunes.

In 1976 the Lake Woodruff Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. <p>The Native Americans who once lived here harvested the rich food supply and left behind mounds, middens, and artifacts dating back 10,000 years. The native population began to dwindle after the Spanish explorers arrived in the early 1500s. In 1823, Major Joseph Woodruff acquired the DeLeon Springs area (the infamous Fountain of Youth) and gave his name to the nearby lake. In 1964, the same year the Wilderness Act was passed, more than 18,500 acres were set aside as Lake Woodruff National Wildlife Refuge, a migratory bird habitat. About one-fourth of the refuge is timbered swamps. <p>You'll find very little evidence of human domination in this country of freshwater marshes, lakes, and streams, just plenty of wildlife.

As the ice melted from within this formation of rock and soil, a landscape of rolling hills and wetlands developed known as the Missouri Coteau. The Lostwood Wilderness is located in the Missouri Coteau and is dominated by northern mixed grass prairie. Over 100 species of grasses can be found in this area and numerous species of wildflowers brighten the landscape from April through August. Lostwood Wilderness is home to an abundance of breeding waterfowl as well as many species of grassland dependent songbirds including, Baird's, La Conte's, grasshopper, and savannah sparrows, and Sprague's pipit. <p>The climate of this area is typical of the Northern Great Plains, with annual precipitation ranging from 12-17 inches. Typically the months of May and June receive the most moisture with the remaining summer months hot and dry. It is not uncommon to exceed temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer months and 20-30 degrees below zero during the winter.

In 1976 the Medicine Lake Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. <p>Medicine Lake National Wildlife Refuge lies within the glacial drift prairie of northeastern Montana. The gentle rolling hills and numerous shallow wetland depressions were created by repeated advances and retreats of glaciers. More than 12,000 years ago, a one to three mile-wide valley bordered by pre- and postglacial terraces was formed by a glacial front along the ancient route of the Missouri River. Several buried glacial outwash channels and the buried ancestral Missouri River channel created the Clear Lake Acquifer which lies under the eastern portion of the refuge. Medicine Lake is a large shallow lake which filled this ancient valley. The Medicine Lake Wilderness includes the main water body of the lake and the islands within the lake. The Sandhills Wilderness area is located southeast of the lake where large sand deposits formed from prevailing northwest winds which scoured sand from the lake bed. The sand deposits formed choppy sand dunes ranging between 20 and 40 feet in height. <p>The 31,660-acre Medicine Lake National Wildlife Refuge conserves diverse wetlands and grasslands to provide breeding grounds for migratory birds and other wildlife.

In 1976 the Mingo Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. <p>Eighteen thousand years ago, the Mississippi River flowed through this area on its way to the Gulf of Mexico. Because of natural events, the river shifted east forming a biologically rich swampland comprised of bottomland hardwoods intermixed with cypress and tupelo. The former channel basin attracted Native Americans who utilized the bountiful natural resources. By the late 1800's, settlers and loggers started draining the swamp while removing large tracts of old-growth forest. In 1944, Congress authorized the purchase of the remnant forest lands to create the 21,592 acre Mingo National Wildlife Refuge. Today, Mingo Wilderness is a large fragment of this refuge. The wilderness provides critical food and shelter for bald eagles and migratory waterfowl along the Mississippi Flyway. Giant cypress dominates the wilderness swamp offering nesting platforms for eagles and other birds. Otters and beaver, turkey and amphibians are frequent sightings for visitors. Predator-proof nesting boxes, used commonly by the evasive wood ducks, dot the refuge. <p>The western one-third of the refuge offers a wilderness setting with diverse habitat and abundant wildlife, an area highlighted with gentle rolling hills of the Ozark Plateau nestled beside Monopoly Marsh with intersecting streams and rich swamplands.

All of the Wilderness is in the state of Georgia. In 1974 the Okefenokee Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. <p>Imagine waking to a mist enshrouded wetland, echoing with the calls of herons and ibis. Your camping site is a wooden platform surrounded by miles and miles of wet-prairie or moss-covered cypress. The only sounds you hear are the calls of native wildlife and those you make upon taking in such beauty. This is what it is like to experience a night in the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) Wilderness Area! The Okefenokee NWR encompasses the Okefenokee Swamp, one of the oldest and best-preserved freshwater areas in America. This vast bog, measuring about 38 miles long and 25 miles wide, lies inside a huge depression that was once on the ocean floor. The refuge extends just over the state line into Florida. The interior wetlands of the Okefenokee Swamp within Georgia have been designated the state's largest Wilderness. <p>Native Americans called the swamp the ""land of trembling earth"" because the unstable peat deposits that cover much of the swamp floor tremble when stepped on. ""Okefenokee"" is a European interpretation of their words. The last Native Americans to seek sanctuary here, the Seminole, were driven out of the swamp and into Florida in 1850, and lived on to become the only Native Americans to refuse to sign a treaty with the U.S. government. <p>The Okefenokee Swamp forms the headwaters for two very distinct rivers. The historic Suwannee River originates in the heart of the swamp and flows southwest toward the Gulf of Mexico. The second is the St. Marys River, which originates in the southeastern portion of the swamp, and flows to the Atlantic Ocean, forming part of the boundary between Georgia and Florida. <p>The swamp provides a rich diversity of habitat types that support numerous species of wildlife and plants - islands, lakes, cypress forests, scrub-shrub areas, and open wet ""prairies"". Fire and water define the swamp's habitats. Lakes and prairies are created after long droughts when fire burns off layers of vegetation and peat. Rain water replenishes the swamp, filling in the open spaces created by fire. Later, cycles of drought lower water levels, causing vegetation and displaced peat blow-ups to cover the area again. Fire sweeps through the area once more and the entire process continues again.",12826,30.738461,-82.140784,Okefenokee Wilderness,(912) 496-7836 ,

The rugged Centennial Mountains, rising to more than 9,000 feet, hang above the Centennial Valley wetlands and provide a dramatic backdrop for this remote Refuge. It was here, in the early 1930's, among the inherent solitude and expansive wetlands that the last remaining trumpeter swans (thought to be extinct) were found nesting. Shortly thereafter, in 1935, the Red Rock Lakes National Wildlife Refuge was established. <p>Today, the Refuge contains roughly 50,735 acres with just over 32,000 acres receiving Wilderness designation in 1976. This high mountain Refuge, contains the largest wetland complex within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, as well as a myriad of other habitats. Although many visitors come solely to catch a glimpse of the elegant trumpeter swans or a moose, the Refuge often surprises visitors with its remoteness and fantastic scenic and wildlife viewing opportunities. <p>The diverse habitats of the Refuge attract a variety of birds, including sandhill cranes,sage grouse, great blue herons, willets, avocets, long-billed curlews, grebes, short-eared horned owls, bald eagles, peregrine falcons, marsh wrens, mountain bluebirds, tree swallows, western meadowlarks, vesper sparrows and 18 species of duck to name a few.

Saint Lazaria has two low summits, forested with mature Sitka spruce, which are connected by a bare saddle that is washed by waves at high tide. Cliffs topped with lush grasses fall to the sea. <p>Among the tangled tree roots are the burrows of petrels, tufted puffins, and rhinoceros auklets. Pigeon guillemots create a nest-scrape in rocky crevices near common murres, glaucous-winged gulls, and pelagic cormorants. Just under half a million birds lay their eggs on Saint Lazaria, where overcast skies drizzle rain and winds blow moderately to strong throughout much of the year. People are asked to not land on the island, and especially not to walk around. Burrows are crushed easily (as are the occupants), and many birds may abandon their nest when disturbed, allowing the bolder gulls, crows, and ravens to swoop in and feed on eggs and chicks.",12828,56.987455,-135.711326,Saint Lazaria Wilderness,907-235-6546,

An estimated 400,000 caribou winter here now, the Western Arctic herd feeding on the lichen-covered foothills. Moose, bears, and smaller furbearing animals are plentiful. <p>Selawik's most prominent feature is an extensive system of tundra wetlands lying between the Waring Mountains and the Selawik Hills, nesting ground for hundreds of thousands of waterfowl, including birds from six continents. Asiatic whooper swans nest in Selawik and nowhere else in North America. Eskimo curlews, now considered extinct, once flew here and, perhaps, still hide in the great open distances. Yes, this is a bird-watcher's paradise. <p>Straddling the Arctic Circle, the refuge holds thousands of lakes, ponds, rivers (including the Kobuk and Selawik Rivers), river deltas, streams, and estuaries.

More than 2.4 million birds, almost half the breeding seabirds of the Alaska Peninsula Unit, nest on the Semidis. Aghiluk Island alone, the largest of the Semidis, is home to more than half a million birds. About 370,000 horned puffins nest in the Semidis along with almost all of the unit's northern fulmars and jaegers, and one million-plus murres. Ancient murrelets and parakeet auklets are among the other species found here.

It was established in 1938 as a refuge breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. Tamarac is a land of rolling forested hills interspersed with lakes, rivers, marshes, bogs and shrub swamps. The token of the refuge is the Tamarack tree. This unusual tree is a deciduous conifer, turning brilliant gold before losing its needles each fall. Tamarac's wilderness consists of four sections of the 42,738- acre refuge: three islands in Tamarac Lake (totaling 65 acres in the southwest section) and the 2000 acre northwest corner. Here you will find stands of mature white pines, a favorite nesting tree of bald eagles. <p>Historically, the refuge was a prized hunting, fishing, ricing and maple sugaring area for Native American tribes. The Sioux once controlled the area followed by the Ojibwe. Today the northern half of the refuge lies within the original White Earth Indian Reservation established in 1867. Tribal members continue to hunt, fish, trap and harvest herbs, berries and wild rice on the refuge. <p>Tamarac lies in the heart of one of the most diverse transition zones in North America, where northern hardwood, coniferous forests and the tall grass prairie converge. This diversity of habitat brings with it a wealth of wildlife. There are over 250 species of birds and 50 species of mammals. Spring on the refuge attracts a magnificent warbler migration and fall is highlighted with an abundance of waterfowl including more than 15,000 ring-necked ducks at its peak. Bald eagles are common and wolves are occasionally seen. Tamarac is one of the premier production areas for trumpeter swans in the lower 48 states.

In 1980 the Unimak Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System.<p> At almost one million acres, huge Unimak Island extends west from the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. Only a relatively thin strip of sea separates Unimak from Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, and Unimak Island may someday transfer from being a subunit of the Aleutian Islands Unit of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge to being a part of Izembek. About 93 percent of Unimak Island has been designated Wilderness. <p>Here you'll see the nearly perfect cone of Shishaldin Volcano, the highest cone in the Aleutians. At 9,372 feet, it served as a navigational aid first for Aleuts and later for Russian seafarers. Shishaldin and two other Unimak volcanoes are active, surrounded by extensive lava flows and fields of bare ash. On the highest peaks of the island lie perpetual snowfields, some covering glaciers. Fisher Caldera has gone dormant and is now filled with icy water. <p>The coastline features steep bluffs with many offshore sea stacks where seabirds and marine mammals may be seen frequently. Near the shoreline, wetlands provide nesting, feeding, and resting habitat for waterfowl and shorebirds, including whistling swans, geese (Canada, emperor, and black brant), sea ducks, mallards, pintails, gadwalls, green-winged and common teal, common goldeneyes, and greater scaup. Brown bears have migrated to Unimak, swimming from the mainland and living near caribou, wolves, and wolverines. <p>The coast of Unimak offers sea kayaking possibilities, and the interior, although typically wet and virtually without trail, provides an opportunity to hike across rolling tundra and treeless grasslands, a wild and lonesome land. Carry a stove and plenty of fuel; firewood is scarce away from the driftwood-littered shore.",12841,54.753227,-163.995884,Unimak Wilderness,907-235-6546 ,

These colors are startling and unexpected in an area where the usual grayish green tones of sage and greasewood are expected. The area's varied topography makes for an easily achieved experience of solitude. Sagebrush is the dominant vegetation type, with saltbush and greasewood occurring at the lower elevations.

Turning away from the canyon rims, the view becomes a 360 degree panorama of valleys, terraces and mountain ranges up to sixty mils away. The many cliffs and rock formation supports a wide range of wildlife habitats including a nesting raptor population of golden eagles, prairie falcons, hawks and owls. The canyon floors and walls are home to excellent populations of quail and chukar. Shaded canyons support a small yearlong mule deer population which swells with winter migrants.

"The High Rock Lake Wilderness (59,107 acres) contains the northern portion of the Calico Mountains. Much of the area consists of large mesa which slants downward to the east. The west side of the area consists of rim rock bluffs and the northwest corner is occupied by the intermittent High Rock Lake. High Rock Lake was created about 14,000 years ago after a large rockslide closed the original outlet to High Rock and Little High Rock canyons.

"The Big Bend Scenic Byway is made up of two outstanding corridors, the Forest Trail and the Coastal Trail. Back in the 1800s the Forest Trail was truly the ""Wild West"", with cowboys, rustlers, Indians, trappers, and hard-scrabble farmers. Start the day walking through a pioneer farm and stop later at Fort Braden, a military outpost during the Second Seminole War. See rolling sand hills and hardwood forests give way to extensive stretches of pine forests, wetlands, and river floodplains. Come to the Apalachicola National Forest, which features the best remaining example of a native Longleaf Pine and Wiregrass ecosystem in the United States, as well as the largest population of the endangered Red-Cockaded Woodpecker. See the mysterious Dwarf Cypress Dome, where trees over 300 years old are only 6-15 feet tall.The Coastal Trail was first discovered in 1528 by Panfilo de Narvaez and was occupied by Spanish, English, American, and Confederate forces. In the 1800s, the rivers were full of ships with cotton and timber bound for foreign markets. Later they were replaced by sponge, shrimp, crab, oyster, and fishing boats, which still ply these waters. This rich heritage beckons you to explore barrier islands, sand dunes, beaches, bays, coastal marshes, and springs of the Coastal Trail. Visit the Edward Ball Wakulla Springs State Park, one of the world's largest and deepest fresh water springs. If geology is of interest to you, the interpretive trail at Leon Sinks Geological Site is a must. Created over millions of years, its Karst Topography of mysterious underground caverns and magical subterranean lakes make this site of global scientific interest.",13575,,,Big Bend Scenic Byway,,
"Along this twisting byway, visitors can expect to seespectacular views of rugged rocky peaks and beautiful mountain streams. Moving up in elevation is like a layer cake of biological zones, each with its own microcosm of temperature, water, geology, and sun aspect. The canyons are named for the enormous cottonwood trees that grew near the creek bottoms, and are known today for the aspen forests that burst into eye-popping shades of red, orange, and yellow each fall. All along thisbyway, you will find picnic areas, campgrounds, and hiking trails.Bounded by the Mount Olympus and Lone Peak Wilderness Areas, Big Cottonwood Canyon provides refuge for a surprising diversity of wildlife so close to an urban environment. Resident species include large mammals such as mule deer, elk, moose, mountain goat,mountain lion, and bear. Small mammals include coyote, fox, beaver, badger, ferret, rabbit, mice, marmot, and others. Bird sightings include a range of raptors from hawks to eagles, as well as owls and migratory birds. Reptiles, amphibians, and fish live in and around areas with water. Visitors often spot canyon wildlife along the water's edge at dusk or dawn.The Wasatch Mountains reach over 11,000' and the picturesque winding canyon roads access communities as high as 8,500'. Tectonic activity long ago formed the flat valleys and high mountains that each winter trap storms moving in from the west, dropping 20 to 50 feet of world-famous powder snow. Near the top of the canyon, the ski areas at Brighton and Solitude offer world-class skiing over some of Utah's most beautiful terrain.",13576,,,Big Cottonwood Canyon Scenic Byway,801-733-2660,

Today twin columns greet you as you enter one of the earliest  National Forests in the eastern United States.

When Louis Carr purchased the rights to ""all timber, wood and bark standing and down"" from Vanderbilt, he built rail lines along creeks to bring out the timber. These old cuts now form the path for some stretches of the byway.Fill your camera with priceless photos of Looking Glass Falls.

"This highway connects the Inside Passage community of Haines with Haines Junction in the Yukon Territory. First used by the Chilkat Indians, the highway became a packhorse trail to the Klondike goldfields in the late 1880s. In 1943, the U.S. Army used the highway as a military access road during World War II.The story of the Haines Highway is how the highway is submerged in the natural and cultural settings of the true home of the Bald Eagle.  The most significant natural resource along the Haines Highway is the Chilkat River and the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve. The byway runs through the Alaska Chilkat Bald Eagle Preserve along the Chilkat River and through the prime eagle roosting and feeding grounds. This Preserve and its ecosystem are of national and world significance due to hosting the largest congregation of bald eagles in one location. The Chilkat River has the last salmon run in Southeast Alaska and during the months from October to February, more than 3,500 bald eagles will congregate within this 48,000-acre preserve to feed on the late spawning salmon. The eagles fly from more than 100 miles, as far away as the Yukon, to gather at the preserve.The Chilkat River is a very unique body of water within the State of Alaska. Most rivers in Southeast Alaska fall from very high mountain elevations rapidly down to the sea and have a very short length. While this may be a typical river in other parts of Alaska, the river remains warm and ice-free throughout the year creating a unique environment in the region. The combination of slow, meandering river currents, gravel aquifers, and consistent water temperature provides a most unusual and exceptional situation for spawning fish and their eggs. The Tlingit name Chilkat means 'winter storage container for salmon.' All species of Alaskan salmon spawn in the Chilkat River and its tributaries. This offers a massive volume of food for a wide variety of creatures, including the bald eagle, black bear, and brown bear. Eulachon is another fish that spawns annually in the Chilkat River. This smelt-like fish spawns in the millions every spring and is extremely high in oil content. This unique ecosystem and its hydrology and geology tells a fascinating story to visitors.This rich environment is home to a wide variety of creatures. A visit to Haines and the surrounding area offers chances to see many mammals and birds including moose, wolf, coyotes, sea otters, mountain goats, lynx, beavers, sea lions, humpback whales and orca whales. More than 120 species of birds have been sighted in this valley, including trumpeter swans and arctic terns. The Haines Highway is also home to the Tlingit people. Klukwan Village lays approximately halfway along the highway and is home to the Chilkat people. This permanent village offers a view into one of the very few river-based (rather than ocean-based) Tlingit villages in Alaska. The Chilkat River has supported Tlingit people for centuries. Throughout that time, the people of this village have maintained an important cultural relationship with the bald eagle, whose populations have always been particularly high in this special place, which the Tlingit people named ""Valley of the Eagles."" Like the eagle, the Tlingit have lived from the riches of the Chilkat River and their stories and cultures are interwoven.During the summer, autumn, and early winter, salmon runs in the river rounds out the diet of eagles. Like the eagles, the Tlingit people also subsisted off the rich year-round fish runs found in the Chilkat River.",13682,,,Haines Highway - Valley of the Eagles,907-766-2234,

"The story of Oklahoma's Route 66 is the story of American transportation in the 20th Century. The Oklahoma section of the Mother Road includes several miles of the original 9-foot road segment that served travelers in their Model A's and T's during the 1920s and '30s. The existing roadbed includes unique trestle bridges and architectural wonders such as Arcadia's round barn, the elegance of the Oklahoma State Capitol, the grandeur of Miami's Coleman Theater and the fifth of Buckminster Fuller's Geodesic dome buildings.The story of Route 66 is the story of Oklahoma. Tulsa native Cyrus Avery, seeking to develop a major east-west route for the new interstate road system being developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, was determined that the route would pass through Oklahoma. Originally proposed as Route 60, the number was changed when a dispute arose with eastern states over the coveted Route 60. The controversy ended when Oklahoma Department of Highways Chief Engineer John Page proposed substituting 66 in place of 60. In the end, the eastern states received their Route 60, which eventually passed into obscurity. But Oklahoma and the other states along the route received the designation of Route 66, for which immortality awaited.Driving Oklahoma's Route 66 allows the traveler to journey through time, offering unique recreational experiences.Only in Oklahoma, can one experience the history of Tulsa's Black Wall Street, the jazz of Oklahoma City's DeepDeuce and the state's rich Native American heritage.

"Along the byway you will find a wide variety of history, agriculture, and culture. Located along the Minnesota River, the Minnesota River Valley National Scenic Byway is a destination in itself. Although time has brought changes, the river valley remains as beautiful as ever. Hardwood forests, 3.8-billion-year-old granite outcrops, and lush prairie grasses remain for you to enjoy. State and local parks dot the valley, inviting you to get out-of-doors all year long, while museums and historic sites offer vivid stories of prairie life.Close your eyes and imagine becoming an explorer for a day. Relax in the tranquility of big bluestem prairie grasses. Watch for Dakota skipper butterflies among purple cornflowers. Scan the expansive blue sky for Bald Eagles or wait quietly at the river's edge to catch a glimpse of a deer at sunset.Too much quiet for you? How about a threshing show with chugging and puffing turn-of-the-century steam engines? A 19th-century musket demonstration? Cross-country skiing? Power shopping in unique specialty stores?

Breathe deeply and inhale the fragrance of the carpet of lavender, shaggy blooms of the native blazing stars, or the intense scent of the common milkweed, much like the lilac. Some of the native grasses grow so tall you could get lost in an expanse of it. Become mesmerized by the waves of grass rippling in the breeze. Study the scattered, gnarly burr oaks and their individual characteristics, as most of these majestic oaks have lived here for well over a hundred years.Respect the voices that come to you as time wafts away, for they may be voices of those who came before you. People have lived here for thousands of years. Everything the original people had was a part of the land, and they respected it. The original inhabitants used various plants for medicine, nourishment, tools, and shelter. They also deftly hunted the bison. The thundering of the thousands of heavy hooves with the billowing dust clouds from the herds are now just records in history books. This nation was built on the backs of pioneers like those who settled this land.

"Leave the mainland behind and come to the most romantic byway in North Carolina -- the Outer Banks Scenic Byway of the barrier islands. Tour its beautiful beaches, thriving wildlife preserves, historic towns, and well-known lighthouses. Travelers make plans to come back even as they leave.Centered around a rich village culture, the Outer Banks Scenic Byway is a must for any traveler looking to escape to a time of front porch talks and simple maritime living.  Explore the Down East community, an up-close look at what life was like before our hectic schedules and tourist-driven cities. The byway's Down East showcases Outer Banks maritime culture with little impact from current-day tourism. A heritage center built by Down East communities reinforces an experience of place with stories, objects, and exhibits. The pronounced flare to the bow of a Harkers Island fishing vessel is a centuries-old boatbuilding tradition unique to regional waters. North Carolina Folk Heritage Awards in recent years have recognized a boat builder, a decoy carver, and a model boat maker -- all from Down East.  Enjoy grand scenic views of barrier islands bracketed by the Atlantic Ocean and an estuarine system of shallow, fertile sounds on North Carolina's Outer Banks Scenic Byway. On half of the byway's 137.8 land miles, visitors view the corridor's wild side of dunes, marsh, and water in the Cape Hatteras and Cape Lookout National Seashores and two national wildlife refuges, Pea Island and Cedar Island. These national seashores and refuges mark the natural element along the byway as special places with beaches, tidal flats, maritime forests, and abundant marine, avian, and terrestrial wildlife.On the byway's Hatteras and Ocracoke Islands, a ""beach vacation"" landscape with outstanding recreation marks eight villages surrounded by national seashore. Historic settlement patterns are visible in ancient live oaks, harbors, old houses, family cemeteries, simple churches, family stores, fish houses, and 19th-century life-saving stations. On Ocracoke and in Down East you'll hear at least two variations of a ""brogue"" or dialect, with echoes of 17th- and early 18th-century English speech patterns.Outer Banks living demands vital knowledge of wildlife, waters, and weather. That knowledge is expressed in rich traditions, building and settlement patterns, occupations, tales, songs, crafts, gardens, remedies, recipes, community events, and place names.  Fishing for a living and hunting are keys to this culture that clings to the coastal edge. Working watermen ply the region's waters from backyard docks, marinas, and public harbors. Pound net stakes are everywhere in the sounds. Waterfowl hunters scan the sky from blinds in marshes and on far-from-land shallow waters and reefs of the sounds. That village culture is intimately linked to striking natural features and nationally significant historic places along the byway corridor.  A collection of the nation's earliest civil works includes four historic lighthouses and eight early U.S. Life-Saving Service or U.S. Coast Guard stations. Villages developed around lighthouses and life-saving stations where byway heroes are honored. Roadless Cape Lookout National Seashore preserves two uninhabited historic villages to tell the stories of long-ago villages. One is near the diamond-painted Cape Lookout Lighthouse (1859). The other, Portsmouth, preserves life-saving service memories and Revolutionary War shipping stories.

Historic pioneer communities ""bookmark"" each end of the route, once traveled by ancient inhabitants to hunt, fish, and gather tools and food.Early settlers desperate for food once crossed the plateau in midwinter using handmade quilts laid atop deep snow to reach settlements to the west. Such quilts are reminders of the patchwork of the byway's unparalleled scenery, vibrant history and natural beauty unequaled across the country.Today, travelers of Utah's Patchwork Parkway begin their trek in historic communities where examples of early Mormon pioneer settlement and culture abound. The communities of Parowan and Panguitch contain a large concentration of 19th-century architecture and historic sites. The entire original Panguitch townsite is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

"The Sherman Pass Scenic Byway exemplifies an exceptional corner of the country--a point where the Columbia River Plateau meets the Northern Rocky Mountains and where the Inland Empire matches up against the British Columbia Interior. The sites and stories found along the route showcase the history of the west, but with a distinct Canadian flavor. Here, the culture of the Plains Indians intersects with that of the Columbia Plateau Salmon Culture. Here, the paths of the Rocky Mountain fur trappers cross with those of the Hudson Bay Company and famed northern explorer David Thompson. Here, the rural settings and rolling mountains and ridgelines allow visitors to imagine a Northwest of times past.Celilo Falls on the Lower Columbia River is famed as a regional gathering place for Native Americans since time immemorial. Kettle Falls, though lesser-known, is considered by archaeologists as an equally important gathering place for Native Americans in the region covered by northern Washington and Idaho, and southern Alberta and British Columbia. Early travel routes flowed west and south down out of the Rockies and east from the Cascades and Okanogan Highlands over present-day Sherman Pass, all leading to this critical aboriginal hub. Today the ""People of the Falls Interpretive Center"" and nearby large sharpening stone share a history dating back 9,000 years.As the tide of non-Native Americans to the region increased, these routes attracted trappers, explorers, prospectors, and later settlers into the area. Communities sprang up along the travel-ways that ignored present-day international boundaries.Initially, David Thompson and a party of Canadian fur traders reached the Kettle Falls during June of 1811. Soon the Falls was home to a Hudson's Bay Trading Post, named Fort Colville, in honor of Mr. Andrew Colville, a committee member of the Hudson's Bay Company at the time the fort was established in 1825. Eventually a large area of land west of the mighty Columbia River reaching from the Canadian Border south to the Okanogan River was set aside for the Confederated Tribes of The Colville Reservation. When gold was discovered in Eureka Creek at the present-day town of Republic in 1892, the north half of the Colville Reservation was purchased for 1.5 million dollars and opened for gold exploration.The economy of the area changed to emphasize timber and recreation resources contained in the now designated Colville National Forest. This history is captured along the byway in sites such as Log Flume that speaks to logging operations, Camp Growden that highlights the role the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) played during the depression era, and White Mountain that details the history of fire-fighting in these ""borderlands.""The history of this corner of the Northwest is much bigger than the byway, but the collection of sites along Sherman Pass Scenic Byway serve as the perfect introduction to all facets of this grand history with the added benefits of beautiful scenery, varied recreation opportunities, and serene settings that leave room for self-discovery.",13842,,,Sherman Pass Scenic Byway,509-779-0115,

"<p>The Whole Enchilada is an Iconic Moab Trail.  Typically run as a downhill ride, this trail runs from Burro Pass on the Manti LaSal National Forest at 11,200 feet 26.5 miles to the Colorado River at 4000 feet over 7000 feet of vertical!  While sections of the trail are slightly easier this is really an advanced trail with very tough, steep decents, large obsticles and some big drops thrown in for good measure.  You can walk around almost everything hard but it would make for a very, very long day to do that for the whole trail.</p><p>The Whole Enchilada includes 6 distinct sections of trail.  These trails are Burro Pass, Hazard County, Kokopelli, Upper Porcupine Singletrack (UPS), Lower Porcupine Singletrack (LPS), and Porcupine Rim.  Most of these are singletrack however there are a few short sections of double track or fire road.  The trail is very well signed and used alot during the summer and fall.

"<p>The White Wash Sand Dunes are located 48 miles northwest of Moab, and 25 miles southeast of Green River.  The Sand Dunes themselves are delineated and fenced for open OHV play; cross country travel is allowed only in the open area.  Outside this area, there are hundreds of miles of designated roads and trails to be enjoyed.  All motorized travel outside the open area must stay on the designated routes. Staying on the designated routes helps keep these routes open for your enjoyment.  Damage to adjoining private property has occurred, and is a threat to your continued enjoyment of this area.  Staying on designated routes assures that you will not trespass on private property.  If you observe any trespassing or damage, do your part to help White Wash and report these actions to the Grand County Sheriff's Department at 435-259-8115 (or 911 for an emergency).</p><p>Whitewash Sand Dunes is an approximately 1400 acre open riding area just south of Green River, Utah.  The open area is signed and fenced along the southern boundary to help people know what is legal for riding.  Within the open area is white wash itself acting as a main artery for riders.  On the south of the wash are the dunes.  These dunes, while not the largest in Utah, are unique in that they have many Cottonwood trees growing directly out of the dunes.  This creates a beautiful setting for riding and has attracted several movies in recent years to film there.   Branching out from the open area are several trails which range from fast open desert riding to techy singletrack hopping up and down ledges and along cliff edges.  There is something for everyone.</p><p>Please avoid the oil production facilities and the adjoining ranch, and never chase or harass livestock. When going through gates, leave them open or closed as you found them. You must stay on designated roads and trails when riding outside the dune area. These routes are marked with white arrows and/or white paint. Bighorn sheep inhabit this area; riders should avoid stressing these animals by giving them the space they need. The cottonwood trees growing in the White Wash area are quite unique. Please avoid damaging these trees -- give them wide berth to reduce potential for soil compaction.</p>",14504,38.803464,-110.04359,Whitewash Sand Dunes Open OHV Area and Trail System,(435)259-2100,
